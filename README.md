# Microsoft Internship guide for Caribbean Students

As of 2024, Microsoft now recruits interns from the Caribbean, as a result of the efforts by the [Project Blue Mountain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/microsoft-day-university-technology-jamaica-thomas-mba-hrm-volie/) team.
The [first cohort](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shoniquethomas_microsoftinterns-microsoftlife-activity-7203425109003403264-laSU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) of Microsoft interns studying in the Caribbean were from Jamaica (University of Technology & University of The West Indies Mona) and Barbados (University of The West Indies Cave Hill). 17 students in total.

We've put together this guide to assist the next groups of interns, from applying and interviewing, to visa concerns.

## Applying for the job
Applications are done on the Microsoft Careers page. Internship roles typically open around November each year. As of writing, not all intern roles are open to the Caribbean, only SWE and TPM.

### Requirements
- Be in university, pursuing a bachelors or masters
- Have atleast 1 semester remaining after the summer (Drop or add courses to qualify if its your last year)

### Timeline
- After applying, you can expect to hear back around 2 weeks, although it can take up to a month for some.
- If you are selected, you will be invited to interview.
  - Interviews are split into multiple rounds with different persons on the same day. Number of rounds may differ by role.
  - Everyone does atleast one behavioural round. For SWE, expect 1 or more technical rounds (however there has been an instance of a SWE intern having no technical interview). You may or may not be asked to code, they care more about your though process.
  - Everything on your resume is fair game for questioning. Know your resume.

## Obtaining a Visa
Yes, Microsoft will assist you in obtaining a J-1 visa to work in the United States. Microsoft uses a third-party (currently Cultural Vistas) to handle this for new hires.

## Interview Prep
### Behavioural Interview
This round of interview is the perfect chance to connect with the interviewers. 
- Although it may be cliche, the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method of responding to questions will allow you to clearly articulate your answers in an order that will not confuse the asker.
- Ensure you are aware of Microsoft Corporate Values: Accountability, Respect and Intgerity. In your responses, try to ilustrate how you embody these characteristics
- A common quality that Microsoft tries to push is the idea of having a "growth mindset." This is defined as an applicant being very curious and willing to learn new things and accept corrections.
- When asked about an experience or skill on your resume, while talking about the technical skills are expected. ensure to state the challenges you had there, how you overcame them, and how you will use your growth mindset to employ your  newfound knowledge in your next workplace or life, as a whole.
