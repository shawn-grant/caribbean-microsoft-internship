# Microsoft Internship Guide for Caribbean Students

As of 2024, Microsoft now recruits interns from the Caribbean, as a result of the efforts by the [Project Blue Mountain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/microsoft-day-university-technology-jamaica-thomas-mba-hrm-volie/) team.
The [first cohort](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shoniquethomas_microsoftinterns-microsoftlife-activity-7203425109003403264-laSU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) of Microsoft interns studying in the Caribbean were from Jamaica (University of Technology & University of The West Indies Mona) and Barbados (University of The West Indies Cave Hill). 17 students in total.

We've put together this guide to assist the next groups of interns, from applying and interviewing, to visa concerns.

## Interview Prep
### Behavioural Interview
This round of interview is the perfect chance to connect with the interviewers. 
- Although it may be cliche, the [STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) of responding to questions will allow you to clearly articulate your answers in an order that will not confuse the asker.
- Ensure you are aware of [Microsoft Corporate Values](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values): Accountability, Respect and Intgerity. In your responses, try to ilustrate how you embody these characteristics
- A common quality that Microsoft tries to push is the idea of having a "growth mindset." This is defined as an applicant being very curious and willing to learn new things and accept corrections.
- When asked about an experience or skill on your resume, while talking about the technical skills are expected. ensure to state the challenges you had there, how you overcame them, and how you will use your growth mindset to employ your  newfound knowledge in your next workplace or life, as a whole.
