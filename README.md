# Microsoft Internship Guide for Caribbean Students

As of 2024, Microsoft now recruits interns from the Caribbean, as a result of the efforts by the [Project Blue Mountain](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/microsoft-day-university-technology-jamaica-thomas-mba-hrm-volie/) team.
The [first cohort](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shoniquethomas_microsoftinterns-microsoftlife-activity-7203425109003403264-laSU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) of Microsoft interns studying in the Caribbean were from Jamaica (University of Technology & University of The West Indies Mona) and Barbados (University of The West Indies Cave Hill). 17 students in total.

We've put together this guide to assist the next groups of interns in landing an internship at Microsoft. These are our own reflections based on personal experience.

## Interview Preparation
### Behavioural Interview
This round of interview(s) is the perfect chance to connect with the interviewers. 
- Although it may be cliche, the [STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) of responding to questions will allow you to clearly articulate your answers in an order that will not confuse the asker.
- Ensure you are aware of [Microsoft Corporate Values](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/corporate-values): Accountability, Respect and Intgerity. In your responses, try to ilustrate how you embody these characteristics
- A common quality that Microsoft tries to push is the idea of having a "growth mindset." This is defined as an applicant being very curious and willing to learn new things and accept corrections.
- When asked about an experience or skill on your resume, while talking about the technical skills are expected. ensure to state the challenges you had there, how you overcame them, and how you will use your growth mindset to employ your  newfound knowledge in your next workplace or life, as a whole.
- Check out [behavioral_questions.pdf](behavioral_questions.pdf) for examples of questions you may be asked during this round.

### Technical (coding) Interview
This round is designed to assess your abilities as a software engineer
- You may be given a [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) style question and about 30 mins to formulate a solution
  - Practice your data structures and algorithmns (DSA)!
- Communicate with the interviewer! Don't just start coding.
  - Ask clarifying questions. Ensure you fully understand the problem before you write code.
  - Ask for examples of inputs and expected outputs
  - Come up with and run through test cases
  - Identify edge cases and plan for them
- During this round it is extremely important to articulate your thought process as you write your solution
- Check out [interview_patterns.py](interview_patterns.py) for common algorithms you should know for your interview.
- Everything on your resume is fair game for questioning. Know your resume well.
- Lastly, be honest! Interviewers can often tell if you've seen a question before by how you answer. It's ok to say that youve seen something similar.

> It is important to note that every round is a behavioural round. Always present yourself as someone people would want to work with.

## Team Placement
Specific team placement happens closer to your start date, however, from our experience it is most likely that you will be placed in the same team or business group as your interviewers. You do not get to pick which team you work with. You may state your preference for a team or product you'd like to work on, but keep in mind your placement is entirely up to your interviewers and hiring manager.
> Note that Linkedin and GitHub, while owned by Microsoft, operate as separate companies. Don't expect to be placed on any team within those companies.
